        Before I started doing my website or project. Seriously I don't know
        anything about coding or building a website using HTML promise. March 29
        2021 around 6pm. I started learning HTML on youtube and hereâ€™s the link
        (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU).<br />It has 1 hour and a
        couple of minutes. But I ended up watching all three hours because at
        the same time I apply it or I imitate what he does. It's so easy for me
        to pick him up and I honestly didn't have a hard time understanding it.
        I just have a hard time remembering the code and especially I don't know
        the full function of the code that he taught. It took me 6 days to
        finish my website or project since i started learning the HTML.<br /><br />When
        I learned the basics of HTML. I immediately think of the Theme of my
        project and I came up with this idea and it's called Synthwave.<br />Base
        on my research Synthwave is an electronic music microgenre that is based
        predominately on the music associated with action, science-fiction, and
        horror film soundtracks, combined with the aesthetic of popular music of
        the 1980s. Other influences are drawn from that decade's art and video
        games.<br />Let's talk about design. I thought of this design because I
        want the outcome to be simple but with extras. The Homepage, Menu,
        Gallery, About, Myproject and Education has simple design but when it
        comes to text and background, the former has a bit extra, especially for
        me. But when I make a project for my users, of course I won't follow
        what I want. I mean I always keep in mind that it should also be okay
        when it comes to interacting with my Target users in my project.

        As you can see the background of my homepage and menu are video but when
        you open the other website links like the Gallery, About, my project,
        education and calendar it's just a background picture.<br />The buttons.
        In my homepage i use text button but when you go to menu the buttons are
        different it is not a text it icon or picture and i created that i get
        reference in google.<br />About the text design. I found something
        interesting design in youtube and i apply it to my project.<br /><br />In
        my calendar design same theme as the others.
