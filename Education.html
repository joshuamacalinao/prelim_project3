        These are the teachers that I like and admire Sir Johanns, Ma'am
        Jazzmine, and Sir Elmer because they work hard to teach everyone, even
        if you have a hard time learning it, they will make you suffer until you
        learn. Well, the others don't make it that difficult but they work hard
        to teach.<br /><br />
        They are the teachers who are worth teaching to me. Because they are so
        diligent and you will surely learn even if they have no consideration.
        you will learn because they are the ones who squeeze your brain until it
        runs out until you finish it.<br /><br />
        Sir Johanns, Kind, simple, and hardworking to teach. I wasn't joking, he
        diligently taught and explained everything in Learning Activities for
        us.<br /><br />
        Ma'am Jazzmine, kind and funny, but when it comes to class there is no
        consideration if you are wrong, you are wrong. She seems to learn from
        your mistake. For me, he will squeeze your brain so that you can do what
        she asks you to do until you learn.<br /><br />
        Sir Elmer, is my instructor this sem. He is a hard worker and has
        discipline with his students. I can't forget him, especially what he
        taught us about Human-Computer Interaction and especially when designing
        User-Centered Designs that Create or Designer for your Users.

        A teacher is a person who plays a pivotal role in molding a student’s
        life. Some teachers remain in your memory as a key to a few life
        problems. A teacher imparts not only academic knowledge but also shares
        ethical values, and imbibes morality that shapes our personality as a
        better human being. A teacher falls next in line with parents to help
        students balance positivity and negativity and spend maximum time of
        childhood in shaping a student’s life. A teacher is a life-changing role
        model who influences your growth development, inculcating important
        everyday values. They are the building blocks of society with immense
        patience, tolerance, and a bright shimmering smile.
